	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>Link-SF was thought up by staff at the Tenderloin Technology Lab, a partnership of San Francisco Network Ministries and the St. Anthony Foundation, as a means to connect those in need to the basic services around them. Through our work, bridging the digital divide, offering free computer training and access, we observed an increase in the use of smart phones by our guests. Link-SF is our attempt to use mobile technology to assist those most in need. As community driven organizations, we strive to be on the forefront of innovative community programs.
