      Link-SF was inspired by staff at the <a href="http://www.tenderlointechnologylab.org/">Tenderloin Technology Lab</a> (TTL) as a means to connect those in need with the basic services around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TTLâ€™s primary goal is to bridge the digital divide by offering free computer training and access.  Yet, after observing an increase in the use of smart phones by TTL guests (primarily low-income, homeless, and/or marginally housed), TTL staff brainstormed around ways to assist their target population outside of the TTL physical space by utilizing this new technology. Link-SF is a result of this process and is an attempt to use mobile technology to assist those most in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a community driven program, we strive to be on the forefront of innovative community projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time in the initial stages of development the TTL was a partnership between San Francisco Network Ministries and the <a href="http://www.stanthonysf.org/">St. Anthony Foundation</a>. Link-SF and the TTL are now completely supported by the St. Anthony Foundation.
